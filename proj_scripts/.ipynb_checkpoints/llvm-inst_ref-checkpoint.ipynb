The type of the <pointer> operand must be a pointer to the first class type of the <value> operand. If the store is marked as volatile, then the optimizer is not allowed to modify the number or order of execution of this store with other volatile operations. Only values of first class types of known size (i.e. not containing an opaque structural type) can be stored.\n",

      "\t\t\tIf the store is marked as atomic, it takes an extra ordering and optional syncscope(\"<target-scope>\") argument. The acquire and acq_rel orderings aren’t valid on store instructions. Atomic loads produce defined results when they may see multiple atomic stores. The type of the pointee must be an integer, pointer, or floating-point type whose bit width is a power of two greater than or equal to eight and less than or equal to a target-specific size limit. align must be explicitly specified on atomic stores, and the store has undefined behavior if the alignment is not set to a value which is at least the size in bytes of the pointee. !nontemporal does not have any defined semantics for atomic stores.\n",

      "\t\t\tThe optional constant align argument specifies the alignment of the operation (that is, the alignment of the memory address). A value of 0 or an omitted align argument means that the operation has the ABI alignment for the target. It is the responsibility of the code emitter to ensure that the alignment information is correct. Overestimating the alignment results in undefined behavior. Underestimating the alignment may produce less efficient code. An alignment of 1 is always safe. The maximum possible alignment is 1 << 29. An alignment value higher than the size of the stored type implies memory up to the alignment value bytes can be stored to without trapping in the default address space. Storing to the higher bytes however may result in data races if another thread can access the same address. Introducing a data race is not allowed. Storing to the extra bytes is not allowed even in situations where a data race is known to not exist if the function has the sanitize_address attribute.\n",
